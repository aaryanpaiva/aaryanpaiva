👑Hi, this is Aaryan Paiva

  My repositories contain all my projects that I have completed/ working on.
    Give them a look, I would reaaly appreciate it!

🧠My interests lie in solving problems by crafting solutions that utilise logic and common sense.

⚒️I'm currently doing ROBOTICS and OPTIMIZATION projetcs.

👋If you have any project that you want to work on and need an extra brain, let's connect.

⌚Coming soon : Data science projects and software.
